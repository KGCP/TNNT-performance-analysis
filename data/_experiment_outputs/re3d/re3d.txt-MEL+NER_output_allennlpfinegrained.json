Such an attack shows the desperation of Daesh as they see their so - called caliphate crumble around them.  At least 43 people have been killed in a car bomb blast in the rebel - held Syrian town of Azaz , near the Turkish border.  Daesh targeted families out shopping for Eid and those celebrating suhur.

Named by Coalition Commanders , \" \" Operation Steel Curtain \" \" , was a hardened sweep and clear mission hence \" \" steel curtain \" \" because one of the SNCOs was a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. \n Over the last year the Global Coalition has launched almost 8 , 000 strikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria and have taken back 30 % of territory ISIL once controlled in Iraq.  The scenarios developed will include border security , command and control , cyber defense and battlespace management.  Many of his comrades also have their own mini front line libraries , he says , adding that at just about every defence point , which are spaced about 50m apart , you will find a collection of borrowed books.

S.  assistance is helping keep schools open for Syrian children ; restoring access to electricity and water infrastructure ; supporting independent media and civil society to hold their local governments accountable , and building the capacity of the moderate opposition to play a role in a future Syria that respects human rights and the rule of law. \n It \u2019 s essential that the regime and its backers provide the United Nations that access with immediate effect.  This is further shocking proof of the horrific and indiscriminate methods the Assad regime is using to kill and injure innocent civilians , including children.  Many in Iraq ' s National Symphony Orchestra have already left.  \" This attack only redoubles our resolve to stand shoulder - to - shoulder with our Turkish allies in condemning these attacks and relentlessly combating terrorism.  At the same time , we are enormously grateful for the tremendous support provided by our Coalition partners , especially the Turks.  In addition to setting conditions for the ultimate liberation of Raqqah , ISIL \u2019 s self - proclaimed capital , the operation will also cut off militants from ISIL in Mosul , Iraq.  Last year ' s influx of hundreds of thousands to Europe partly resulted from cuts to food aid and cash payments.  On Monday , Dec.  26 , Abu Jandal al - Kuwaiti , an ISIL gang leader in Raqqah was struck and killed by a coalition airstrike near Tabqa Dam , Syria. \n \" Coalition nations which have conducted strikes in Syria include Australia , Bahrain , Canada , Denmark , France , Jordan , the Netherlands , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , the United Kingdom , and the United States.  The Iraqi military has said it is looking into the incident.  Who can say when their paths will cross once more or what Iraq will be like then ? But significant gains along the river may open up western Mosul , which is still under IS control , to Iraqi forces seeking to advance.  Donors also want to reduce dependence on handouts.  The Secretary of State has authorized a reward of up to $ 5 million for information leading to the significant disruption of the sale and / or trade of oil and antiquities by , for , on behalf of , or to benefit ISIL , also known by its Arabic acronym as DAESH.

Alsumaria have exclusive rights to broadcast movies , documentaries , musicals , children , entertainment , and sports shows.  The UN says this reinforces fears that IS will use civilians as human shields.  More than 650 , 000 Syrians are registered as refugees in Jordan.  We read how in the past everyone turned their backs on a particular nation , yet they still made it.

These sanctions show that EU is united in its condemnation of Assad \u2019 s brutal policies. . \n This was one of the most appalling incidents of the conflict so far.  With the progress made in both Vienna and now in Riyadh , the International Syria Support Group continues to build a foundation for constructive negotiations in January under UN auspices , regarding a political transition in accordance with the Geneva Communique of 2012.  But if implemented fully , the cessation can open the way to unhindered and countrywide humanitarian access to those in need.  And , most of all , if successful it can open the way to a renewal of intra - Syrian talks under UN auspices , within the framework set by the UN Security Council.  In this respect , we would welcome any intermediate step facilitated by other international players , such as the announced meeting in Astana , if fully inclusive and aimed at preparing a fruitful and meaningful resumption of intra - Syrian talks in Geneva under UN auspices.  To this aim , I have spoken today to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl \u00fc t \u00c7 avu \u015f o \u011f lu and to the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura , to coordinate our work for Syria.

It is imperative for all parties to coordinate closely over the coming days and weeks to ensure unity of effort in defeating Daesh and to provide for the lasting security of the Iraqi people.  Throughout each phase of the campaign to liberate Raqqah , the Coalition will continually consult with allies and partners as we plan for the city \u2019 s ultimate seizure and governance once ISIL is defeated.
