Yancey ----------------------------------------- Chairman DOMINION TERMINAL ASSOCIATES , a General Partnership By : / s / Charles E.  Brinley ----------------------------------------- President 12 < PAGE > EXHIBIT A DESCRIPTION OF FACILITIES ------------------------- The Dominion Terminal Associates coal facility is sized to have an annual throughput of approximately 20 million tons per year.  A total ground storage capacity of approximately 1.  5 million tons is available.  The terminal pier and loading facilities are designed to handle colliers ranging in size from 20 , 000 to 173 , 000 dwt.  and barges of varying sizes.  The land on which the facility is located is on the east bank of the James River in Newport News , Virginia.  It is bordered on the northwest by the Pier IX coal terminal and on the southeast by the CSX Piers 14 and 15 properties which are now limited in use , the primary business of Piers 14 and 15 appearing to be the leasing of the piers. \n Road access to the facility is from Harbor Road , which borders the south side of the terminal site.  1.  Railroad Service.  The coal terminal facility is served by CSX Transportation , Inc.  CSX brings loaded cars to the empty tracks.  DTA moves the loaded cars from the empty tracks into position for dumping and then moves the cars back to the empty tracks.  2.  Material Handling System.  The material handling system is designed so that coal may be unloaded from the railroad hopper cars and transported by conveyor directly to the shiploader for depositing in the holds of vessels. \n An enclosed tandem rotary car dumper is used to unload the hopper cars two at a time.  The coal deposited in the hoppers beneath the dumper passes through a grizzly which prevents large foreign material from entering and damaging the belt conveying system.  Just prior to dumping , the rail cars pass through a thaw shed which assists in unloading during freezing weather.  Vibrating feeders transfer the coal from the receiving hoppers to the conveyor belts and place it on conveyor belts for elevation up above grade to a 1 , 000 - ton surge silo.  The surge silo is used to increase unloading efficiency by allowing the coal to accumulate while the stacker / reclaimer is moving from one stockpile to another.  A three - stage \" as received \" sampling system is provided at the 1 , 000 - ton storage silo.  While the unloading system is in operation , coal received may be diverted directly to waiting colliers or barges or transferred to either of two stacker / reclaimers for stacking in stockpiles.  The design rate for the receiving material handling system is 5 , 200 tons / hr.  A - 1 < PAGE > The reclaim system provides for reclaiming coal with either or both stacker / reclaimers and a reclaimer , then conveying it to two - 4 , 000 ton surge silos located near the pier. \n When blending two different types of coal is required , the proper percentage of each is withdrawn from each silo.  An \" As Shipped \" sampling system is located at the tail end of the conveyor leading to the shiploader.  Belt scales are provided for both the unloading system and the shiploading system to provide the necessary information for managing the coal stockpiles , blending and as a check against the draft surveyor ' s measurement for the coal being loaded in vessels.  The design rate for the reclaim handling system is 6 , 800 tons / hr.  The shiploader and dock conveyor is rated at 6 , 500 tons / hr.  The higher capacity takes into account shiploader shutdowns for hatch changes.  3.  Marine Facilities.  The marine facilities include a dredge deep - water basin and shiploader pier. \n An area on the south side of the pier has been dredged to a depth of 50 feet to match the existing channel.  The north side of the pier can be dredged to a depth of 50 feet if so necessitated by an increase in business.  The shiploader dock is designed as a finger pier with a berth on each side for loading colliers up to 173 , 000 dwt.  It is provided with a trestle connection to shore.  The pier supports the shiploading conveyor and shiploader , plus a roadway with a turnaround area at the offshore end.  Both faces of the pier are provided with a fendering system.  A turning dolphin has been constructed at the outer end , connected by a walkway to the pier.  4.  Mobile Equipment. \n Switch engines are used to move trains while dozers are needed to assist the bucket wheel stackers and reclaimers in storing and reclaiming coal outside their reach.  The following types of mobile equipment are provided for the facility : a.  Track - mounted dozers with coal blades ; b.  Switch Engines ; c.  Mobile cranes ; d.  Flat - bed trucks ; e.  Pickup trucks ; f.  Automobiles ; g.  Maintenance vehicles ; and h. \n A - 2 < PAGE > 5.  Control Stations.  The rotary dumper and the receiving hopper vibrating feeders have a separate control panel located in the dumper building.  The shiploader and stacker / reclaimers and reclaimer are controlled from cabs mounted as part of their construction.  The systems of conveyors leading to and from yard storage are controlled from a central control room atop transfer tower TT2 or from other computer sites.  The shiploader and the vibrating feeders under the two 4 , 000 - ton shiploader surge silos are controlled by an operator in the cab of the shiploader.  6.  Auxiliary Buildings.  The following auxiliary buildings are provided for the coal terminal operation : a. \n Repair shop and warehouse ; c.  A series of small buildings to house electrical equipment ; d.  A series of small buildings to house pumping equipment ; and e.  A maintenance building.  7.  Utilities and Communications.  Industrial and potable water is available at the coal terminal site.  This water is delivered by underground pipelines to the areas requiring its use.  A fuel storage and distribution system is provided. \n Electricity is provided to the facility from a main substation located near the property boundary.  A complete distribution system is included to carry electric power to all facilities.  The sewage collected from the various auxiliary buildings is delivered to a nearby existing manhole located near Pier 14.  The sewage is then directed to the Newport News Treatment Plant.  The facilities have a communications system , including telephones located in critical locations and a radio system for communications between operators at the various control stations.  8.  Pollution Control Equipment.  A full complement of pollution control equipment was installed for the facility , as required by the owner - obtained environmental permits.  This includes a combination of water sprays and baghouse - type dust collectors located at critical facility dust emission points. \n 1 and otherwise party hereto , including without limitation , SVB and GOLD HILL VENTURE LENDING 03 , L.

Yancey ----------------------------------------- Chairman DOMINION TERMINAL ASSOCIATES , a General Partnership By : / s / Charles E.  Brinley ----------------------------------------- President 12 < PAGE > EXHIBIT A DESCRIPTION OF FACILITIES ------------------------- The Dominion Terminal Associates coal facility is sized to have an annual throughput of approximately 20 million tons per year.  A total ground storage capacity of approximately 1.  5 million tons is available.  The terminal pier and loading facilities are designed to handle colliers ranging in size from 20 , 000 to 173 , 000 dwt.  and barges of varying sizes.  The land on which the facility is located is on the east bank of the James River in Newport News , Virginia.  It is bordered on the northwest by the Pier IX coal terminal and on the southeast by the CSX Piers 14 and 15 properties which are now limited in use , the primary business of Piers 14 and 15 appearing to be the leasing of the piers. \n Road access to the facility is from Harbor Road , which borders the south side of the terminal site.  1.  Railroad Service.  The coal terminal facility is served by CSX Transportation , Inc.  CSX brings loaded cars to the empty tracks.  DTA moves the loaded cars from the empty tracks into position for dumping and then moves the cars back to the empty tracks.  2.  Material Handling System.  The material handling system is designed so that coal may be unloaded from the railroad hopper cars and transported by conveyor directly to the shiploader for depositing in the holds of vessels. \n An enclosed tandem rotary car dumper is used to unload the hopper cars two at a time.  The coal deposited in the hoppers beneath the dumper passes through a grizzly which prevents large foreign material from entering and damaging the belt conveying system.  Just prior to dumping , the rail cars pass through a thaw shed which assists in unloading during freezing weather.  Vibrating feeders transfer the coal from the receiving hoppers to the conveyor belts and place it on conveyor belts for elevation up above grade to a 1 , 000 - ton surge silo.  The surge silo is used to increase unloading efficiency by allowing the coal to accumulate while the stacker / reclaimer is moving from one stockpile to another.  A three - stage \" as received \" sampling system is provided at the 1 , 000 - ton storage silo.  While the unloading system is in operation , coal received may be diverted directly to waiting colliers or barges or transferred to either of two stacker / reclaimers for stacking in stockpiles.  The design rate for the receiving material handling system is 5 , 200 tons / hr.  A - 1 < PAGE > The reclaim system provides for reclaiming coal with either or both stacker / reclaimers and a reclaimer , then conveying it to two - 4 , 000 ton surge silos located near the pier. \n When blending two different types of coal is required , the proper percentage of each is withdrawn from each silo.  An \" As Shipped \" sampling system is located at the tail end of the conveyor leading to the shiploader.  Belt scales are provided for both the unloading system and the shiploading system to provide the necessary information for managing the coal stockpiles , blending and as a check against the draft surveyor ' s measurement for the coal being loaded in vessels.  The design rate for the reclaim handling system is 6 , 800 tons / hr.  The shiploader and dock conveyor is rated at 6 , 500 tons / hr.  The higher capacity takes into account shiploader shutdowns for hatch changes.  3.  Marine Facilities.  The marine facilities include a dredge deep - water basin and shiploader pier. \n An area on the south side of the pier has been dredged to a depth of 50 feet to match the existing channel.  The north side of the pier can be dredged to a depth of 50 feet if so necessitated by an increase in business.  The shiploader dock is designed as a finger pier with a berth on each side for loading colliers up to 173 , 000 dwt.  It is provided with a trestle connection to shore.  The pier supports the shiploading conveyor and shiploader , plus a roadway with a turnaround area at the offshore end.  Both faces of the pier are provided with a fendering system.  A turning dolphin has been constructed at the outer end , connected by a walkway to the pier.  4.  Mobile Equipment. \n Switch engines are used to move trains while dozers are needed to assist the bucket wheel stackers and reclaimers in storing and reclaiming coal outside their reach.  The following types of mobile equipment are provided for the facility : a.  Track - mounted dozers with coal blades ; b.  Switch Engines ; c.  Mobile cranes ; d.  Flat - bed trucks ; e.  Pickup trucks ; f.  Automobiles ; g.  Maintenance vehicles ; and h. \n A - 2 < PAGE > 5.  Control Stations.  The rotary dumper and the receiving hopper vibrating feeders have a separate control panel located in the dumper building.  The shiploader and stacker / reclaimers and reclaimer are controlled from cabs mounted as part of their construction.  The systems of conveyors leading to and from yard storage are controlled from a central control room atop transfer tower TT2 or from other computer sites.  The shiploader and the vibrating feeders under the two 4 , 000 - ton shiploader surge silos are controlled by an operator in the cab of the shiploader.  6.  Auxiliary Buildings.  The following auxiliary buildings are provided for the coal terminal operation : a. \n Repair shop and warehouse ; c.  A series of small buildings to house electrical equipment ; d.  A series of small buildings to house pumping equipment ; and e.  A maintenance building.  7.  Utilities and Communications.  Industrial and potable water is available at the coal terminal site.  This water is delivered by underground pipelines to the areas requiring its use.  A fuel storage and distribution system is provided. \n Electricity is provided to the facility from a main substation located near the property boundary.  A complete distribution system is included to carry electric power to all facilities.  The sewage collected from the various auxiliary buildings is delivered to a nearby existing manhole located near Pier 14.  The sewage is then directed to the Newport News Treatment Plant.  The facilities have a communications system , including telephones located in critical locations and a radio system for communications between operators at the various control stations.  8.  Pollution Control Equipment.  A full complement of pollution control equipment was installed for the facility , as required by the owner - obtained environmental permits.  This includes a combination of water sprays and baghouse - type dust collectors located at critical facility dust emission points. \n 1 and otherwise party hereto , including without limitation , SVB and GOLD HILL VENTURE LENDING 03 , L.

Section 6.  2 Payment of Taxes.  The Company will pay all taxes and other governmental charges and assessments , if any , that are levied , assessed or imposed upon any interest of the Issuer or the Trustee in this Loan Agreement or any payment received by or due to the Issuer or the Trustee ( other than their fees ) pursuant to this Loan Agreement. \n 3 Arbitrage.  The Company covenants with the Issuer and for and on behalf of the purchasers and owners of the Bonds from time to time outstanding that , so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding , moneys on deposit in any fund in connection with the Bonds , whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds or from any other sources , will not be used in a manner which will cause the Bonds to be \" arbitrage bonds \" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code , and any lawful regulations promulgated thereunder , as they exist on this date , or may from time to time hereafter be amended , supplemented or revised.  Section 6.  4 Company ' s Obligation with Respect to Tax Exemption of Interest Paid on the Bonds.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Agreement , the Company covenants and agrees that it will not knowingly take or authorize or permit , to the extent such action is within its control , any action to be taken with respect to the Project , or the proceeds of the Bonds ( including investment earnings ), insurance , condemnation , or any other proceeds derived directly or indirectly in connection with the Project , which will result in the loss of the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code ( except for any Bond during any period while it is held by a person referred to in Section 147 ( a ) of the Code ); and the Company also will not knowingly omit to take any action in its power which , if omitted , would cause the above result.  The inclusion of interest on any Bond in the computation of the alternative minimum tax imposed by Section 55 of the Code or the branch profits tax on foreign corporations imposed by Section 884 of the Code does not constitute a loss of the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code within the meaning of this Section.

Yancey ----------------------------------------- Chairman DOMINION TERMINAL ASSOCIATES , a General Partnership By : / s / Charles E.  Brinley ----------------------------------------- President 12 < PAGE > EXHIBIT A DESCRIPTION OF FACILITIES ------------------------- The Dominion Terminal Associates coal facility is sized to have an annual throughput of approximately 20 million tons per year.  A total ground storage capacity of approximately 1.  5 million tons is available.  The terminal pier and loading facilities are designed to handle colliers ranging in size from 20 , 000 to 173 , 000 dwt.  and barges of varying sizes.  The land on which the facility is located is on the east bank of the James River in Newport News , Virginia.  It is bordered on the northwest by the Pier IX coal terminal and on the southeast by the CSX Piers 14 and 15 properties which are now limited in use , the primary business of Piers 14 and 15 appearing to be the leasing of the piers. \n Road access to the facility is from Harbor Road , which borders the south side of the terminal site.  1.  Railroad Service.  The coal terminal facility is served by CSX Transportation , Inc.  CSX brings loaded cars to the empty tracks.  DTA moves the loaded cars from the empty tracks into position for dumping and then moves the cars back to the empty tracks.  2.  Material Handling System.  The material handling system is designed so that coal may be unloaded from the railroad hopper cars and transported by conveyor directly to the shiploader for depositing in the holds of vessels. \n An enclosed tandem rotary car dumper is used to unload the hopper cars two at a time.  The coal deposited in the hoppers beneath the dumper passes through a grizzly which prevents large foreign material from entering and damaging the belt conveying system.  Just prior to dumping , the rail cars pass through a thaw shed which assists in unloading during freezing weather.  Vibrating feeders transfer the coal from the receiving hoppers to the conveyor belts and place it on conveyor belts for elevation up above grade to a 1 , 000 - ton surge silo.  The surge silo is used to increase unloading efficiency by allowing the coal to accumulate while the stacker / reclaimer is moving from one stockpile to another.  A three - stage \" as received \" sampling system is provided at the 1 , 000 - ton storage silo.  While the unloading system is in operation , coal received may be diverted directly to waiting colliers or barges or transferred to either of two stacker / reclaimers for stacking in stockpiles.  The design rate for the receiving material handling system is 5 , 200 tons / hr.  A - 1 < PAGE > The reclaim system provides for reclaiming coal with either or both stacker / reclaimers and a reclaimer , then conveying it to two - 4 , 000 ton surge silos located near the pier. \n When blending two different types of coal is required , the proper percentage of each is withdrawn from each silo.  An \" As Shipped \" sampling system is located at the tail end of the conveyor leading to the shiploader.  Belt scales are provided for both the unloading system and the shiploading system to provide the necessary information for managing the coal stockpiles , blending and as a check against the draft surveyor ' s measurement for the coal being loaded in vessels.  The design rate for the reclaim handling system is 6 , 800 tons / hr.  The shiploader and dock conveyor is rated at 6 , 500 tons / hr.  The higher capacity takes into account shiploader shutdowns for hatch changes.  3.  Marine Facilities.  The marine facilities include a dredge deep - water basin and shiploader pier. \n An area on the south side of the pier has been dredged to a depth of 50 feet to match the existing channel.  The north side of the pier can be dredged to a depth of 50 feet if so necessitated by an increase in business.  The shiploader dock is designed as a finger pier with a berth on each side for loading colliers up to 173 , 000 dwt.  It is provided with a trestle connection to shore.  The pier supports the shiploading conveyor and shiploader , plus a roadway with a turnaround area at the offshore end.  Both faces of the pier are provided with a fendering system.  A turning dolphin has been constructed at the outer end , connected by a walkway to the pier.  4.  Mobile Equipment. \n Switch engines are used to move trains while dozers are needed to assist the bucket wheel stackers and reclaimers in storing and reclaiming coal outside their reach.  The following types of mobile equipment are provided for the facility : a.  Track - mounted dozers with coal blades ; b.  Switch Engines ; c.  Mobile cranes ; d.  Flat - bed trucks ; e.  Pickup trucks ; f.  Automobiles ; g.  Maintenance vehicles ; and h. \n A - 2 < PAGE > 5.  Control Stations.  The rotary dumper and the receiving hopper vibrating feeders have a separate control panel located in the dumper building.  The shiploader and stacker / reclaimers and reclaimer are controlled from cabs mounted as part of their construction.  The systems of conveyors leading to and from yard storage are controlled from a central control room atop transfer tower TT2 or from other computer sites.  The shiploader and the vibrating feeders under the two 4 , 000 - ton shiploader surge silos are controlled by an operator in the cab of the shiploader.  6.  Auxiliary Buildings.  The following auxiliary buildings are provided for the coal terminal operation : a. \n Repair shop and warehouse ; c.  A series of small buildings to house electrical equipment ; d.  A series of small buildings to house pumping equipment ; and e.  A maintenance building.  7.  Utilities and Communications.  Industrial and potable water is available at the coal terminal site.  This water is delivered by underground pipelines to the areas requiring its use.  A fuel storage and distribution system is provided. \n Electricity is provided to the facility from a main substation located near the property boundary.  A complete distribution system is included to carry electric power to all facilities.  The sewage collected from the various auxiliary buildings is delivered to a nearby existing manhole located near Pier 14.  The sewage is then directed to the Newport News Treatment Plant.  The facilities have a communications system , including telephones located in critical locations and a radio system for communications between operators at the various control stations.  8.  Pollution Control Equipment.  A full complement of pollution control equipment was installed for the facility , as required by the owner - obtained environmental permits.  This includes a combination of water sprays and baghouse - type dust collectors located at critical facility dust emission points. \n 1 and otherwise party hereto , including without limitation , SVB and GOLD HILL VENTURE LENDING 03 , L.
