Facedwith a strike by bank workers, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachaedelayed plans to raise taxes on cut-rate loans provided byemployers.\t   Several politicians have charged that the high taxes Kenyansalready pay go into the pockets of government officials or wastefulprojects, and not into providing essential services and repairingcrumbling infrastructure.\t   ``I would like Moi to explain and bring back the money he hasstolen,'' said Kenneth Matiba, who ran second to Moi in the 1992election.\t   The International Monetary Fund has demanded spending cuts andtax hikes, warning that in the absence of corrective measures,Kenya's overall budget deficit for 1997-98 will reach 3.9 percentof the gross domestic product _ more than double the goal of 1.7percent.\t   The IMF last year withheld a dlrs 220 million loan from Kenya,citing official corruption and mismanagement.\t   In contrast to other rallies which have drawn mostly malestudents, Saturday's rally also attracted laborers, businessmen andwomen.\t   They demonstrated at the Kamukunji Grounds, a grassy field inNairobi where Kenyans have often gathered to show theirdissatisfaction with the government.\t   ``We, the people of Kenya, have met here several times. We havebeen beaten, we have shed blood, we have purchased the right tomeet here today with our blood,'' said John Munuve, an assemblyleader.\t   The protest was peaceful, and no police were deployed.\t   In July, police killed more than a dozen demonstrators pressingfor constitutional reforms before elections in December, in whichMoi won a fifth, five-year term.\t   (cm-kjd) APW19980314.0392  NEWS STORY  03/14/1998 10:36:00 Russian show of power in World Cup finale OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Russia's Alexey Prokurorov had no realchallengers as he won the 50-kilometer classical-style crosscountry World Cup race in Holmenkollen Saturday, clocking 2 hours,32 minutes, 25.3 seconds.\t   Four Norwegians chased behind, but Odd Bjorn Hjelmeseth, BjornDahlie, Anders Aukland and Erling Jevne had to settle with secondto fifth places.

Lacroix has evolved quite far away from his famous shawland sloped shoulder looks of opening days over 10 years ago.\t   The most modern-looking clothes were simply-cut soft gowns andtrouser outfits in black, gray and white pearled and diamantefabrics with a milky way effect.\t   And the party scene was complete in the Victorians or southernbelle evening styles capped by a fabulous red velvet gown withcrinolines and decollete a la Scarlet O'Hara, draped like curtainsand topped by a little red topper riding hat.\t   Earlier, Jean-Paul Gaultier went yet again to the Arctic Circlefor inspiration - as he did some years ago - but Friday night'soffering was brilliant.\t   The atmosphere was hot and smoky, a bar scene created in theWagram dance hall, notorious for the ``Last Tango in Paris.''\t   But the models, including Naomi Campbell, were dressed up likeNanook of the North as they cavorted, smoked, drank champagne andkibitzed with the audience at the bar.\t   There were many of those Siberian hats with flaps, fur, evensequins at the end, and the parkas were very good-looking, manyquite tailored, in black and white.\t   Some of the impressions were of hippies from outer space, but inspite of some crazy combinations like a layered look with longethnic skirt, fringed tunic and striped blazer, there was much toadmire.\t   The folklore Nordic knits were handsome, in sweaters, orknee-length pants, and might have been topped by something like asuper taffeta full coat.\t   An excellent full gray knit sleeveless tunic with its straightwhite pants was another winner.

Jews wereangered by the pope's audience earlier that year with then AustrianPresident Kurt Waldheim, who was been accused of helping deportJews to Nazi concentration camps, allegations he denied.\t   The Castel Gandolfo meeting was the first time Jewishrepresentatives had sat down for informal discussions with a pope.\t   Representatives at the 1987 meeting said the Vatican planned topublish a major document dealing with anti-Semitism and thegenocide of European Jews by the Nazis in World War II.\t   Since that meeting, John Paul has presided over severalmilestones that improved relations with Jews, including theestablishment of diplomatic relations with Israel in 1995. Theagreement to go ahead and forge ties came in December 1993.\t   Another ground-breaking step was the pope's visit to Rome's mainsynagogue in 1986.\t   Last fall, the pope told a Vatican seminar on anti-Jewishcurrents in Christian theology that centuries of anti-Jewishprejudice had figured in ``deadening'' Christian resistance toe theNazi persecution of Jews. But, to the disappointment of some Jewishgroups, the pope steered clear of blaming the church itself.\t   (fd) \t    APW19980314.0435  NEWS STORY  03/14/1998 11:07:00 Underground political party has big dreams for China BEIJING (AP) _ A small and secretive Chinese opposition partyhas ambitious goals: bringing free elections, political democracyand greater civil liberties than currently allowed by the rulingCommunist Party, a Beijing-based member of the underground groupsays.\t   The 29-year-old member of the China Democratic Justice Partystopped short of saying that they want to see the communistsoverthrown. Instead, he said they wanted to be able to compete onan equal footing with them in elections and ``let the people decidewho rules.''\t   ``When we unite, we won't just be a few hundred or a fewthousand people. We'll be able to grow into several million people,several tens of million,'' he said in an interview, the first by aChina-based member of the group.\t   ``We'll be like the Polish Solidarity union movement, anationwide civil power.''\t   The organization announced its formation last month in faxes toforeign reporters in Beijing. It said it was headquartered withexiled Chinese dissidents in the United States and had members inChina. Until now, however, there had been no way of confirming thegroup's existence with members inside China.\t   The group is the first known opposition party organized bydissidents in China and overseas. But, forced to operate secretlyin small cells, it does not for the moment appear to present anyobvious threat to the communists' nearly 50-year rule.\t   China's constitution allows for freedom of association and otherliberties. But working to change the communist-run system isillegal, and the party relentlessly punishes dissent.\t   Thus, party members in China work in small cells that operateindependently of each other to avoid detection, the party membersaid.\t   He identified himself as Chen Jin, a pseudonym he said he hasused when signing petitions to the government calling fordemocratic change.\t   He was generally circumspect about his own history. He said hegrew up in northeast China, studied in Beijing, where he works as abusiness manager, and took part in democracy protests in 1989 thatstarted on Beijing's Tiananmen Square and spread to other cities.\t   He said there were 17 members in his party cell, one of three inBeijing. The other members range in age and include universitystudents, government bureaucrats, professors, two laborers and alawyer, he said.\t   He estimated the two other cells in Beijing have a similarnumber of members. Another cell operates in Changchun and anotheris planned in Harbin, he said.\t   Both cities are in China's northeast, where dissatisfaction overlayoffs at run-down state firms is mounting.\t   According to New York-based dissident Fu Shenqi, a spokesman forthe group, the party has at least 100 members in five to 10branches in provinces and cities across China.\t   The party's demands include freedom of speech, freedom ofassembly, freedom to protest, freedom of the press, and freedom toset up opposition parties, the Beijing-based member said.\t   ``We all have a common conviction _ bringing politicaldiversification and political democracy to China,'' he said.\t   Asked how the party would recruit members, he described asomewhat vague process whereby party members would start bychatting to ordinary Chinese _ he mentioned taxi drivers, factoryworkers, entrepreneurs and soldiers _ about issues of publicconcern.\t   These could include official corruption within the party andgovernment, layoffs, or other sources of dissatisfaction that havearisen in China's two-decade shift from a planned to a marketeconomy.\t   Through such contacts they would look for suitable people tojoin the party, he said.\t   ``If after one meeting, two meetings, many meetings, we discoverthat they think like us and are willing to operate in anorganization, then they will become a target for us,'' he said.\t   ``When we are strong, the Communist Party will have lost itsruling base, the army won't carry out its orders,'' he added. ``Atthat time, we'll use negotiations to resolve the problems insociety.'' \t    APW19980314.0442  NEWS STORY  03/14/1998 11:15:00 Questions linger two decades after assassination in Italy ROME (AP) _ Twenty years after terrorists kidnapped formerPremier Aldo Moro and left his bullet-riddled body in the back of aparked car, one question still haunts Italy: Could he have beensaved?\t   The anniversary of the kidnapping is being marked by televisionprograms, new books, a play and published interviews with convictedmembers of the Red Brigades who took part in the crime.\t   But the ex-terrorists have only added fuel to the debate aboutthe assassination, which became the defining moment in Italy'sreign of terrorism in the 1970s and early 80s.\t   Moro was abducted in Rome on March 16, 1978, in an ambush thatkilled five of his bodyguards.

We all made a mistake,'' he was quoted as saying by theweekly Vita.\t   But Anna Braghetti, another former Red Brigade member, gave adifferent version, saying the decision to kill Moro came after apoll among 200 members of the gang.\t   The group could not justify sparing Moro's life, given that thegovernment was not compromising and so many of his bodyguards werekilled in an attempt to kidnap him, Braghetti was quoted as sayingby Corriere della Sera.\t   Attempts to close the dark chapter of the ``years of lead'' _ asthe terrorist period is called _ by an amnesty for those convictedof terrorist crimes have been stalled in parliament.
